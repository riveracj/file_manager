# Play Store Deployment Guide - File Manager Pro

## üéâ Your App is Ready!

I've built a complete, professional file manager app with:
- ‚úÖ Beautiful Material 3 UI (light & dark themes)
- ‚úÖ File browsing with grid/list views
- ‚úÖ Search functionality
- ‚úÖ File operations (create, rename, delete, share, open)
- ‚úÖ Storage overview
- ‚úÖ Quick access to common folders

- ‚úÖ Android 13+ permissions support

## üì± Next Steps to Deploy & Make Money

### Step 1: Test the App (When You Have a Device)

When you have access to an Android device or emulator:

```bash
# Connect your Android device via USB (enable USB debugging)
# OR start an Android emulator

flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Step 2: Build Release APK/Bundle

**Option A: Build APK (for testing)**
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```
Output: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

**Option B: Build App Bundle (for Play Store - RECOMMENDED)**
```bash
flutter build appbundle --release
```
Output: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

### Step 3: Create a Google Play Console Account

1. Go to https://play.google.com/console
2. Pay $25 one-time registration fee
3. Complete your account setup

### Step 4: Sign Your App

**Create a keystore:**
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/file-manager-key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias filemanager
```

**Create `android/key.properties`:**
```properties
storePassword=YOUR_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_PASSWORD
keyAlias=filemanager
storeFile=C:/Users/YourName/file-manager-key.jks
```

**Update `android/app/build.gradle.kts`:**

Add this at the top (after imports):
```kotlin
val keystoreProperties = Properties()
val keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file("key.properties")
if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
    keystoreProperties.load(FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
}
```

Inside the `android` block, add:
```kotlin
signingConfigs {
    create("release") {
        keyAlias = keystoreProperties["keyAlias"] as String
        keyPassword = keystoreProperties["keyPassword"] as String
        storeFile = file(keystoreProperties["storeFile"] as String)
        storePassword = keystoreProperties["storePassword"] as String
    }
}

buildTypes {
    getByName("release") {
        signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")
        isMinifyEnabled = true
        isShrinkResources = true
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Prepare Store Listing Assets
